    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in Santa Rosa, California. I am the oldest of four kids. I was lucky enough to grow up with my parents together.</p> <p> My dad is from Peru and came to America when he was a teenager. He ended up going to UC Davis and got a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.</p><p>My mom grew up moving around a lot because my grandfather was in the Air Force. She stopped going to college during her senior to raise me and my sister. Since she raised all of us she is now expecting to graduate this semester and hopes to purse a teaching credential next year.</p><p>My father and mother both instilled in my siblings and I the importance of hard work and pursuing an education. My sisters and I are all going to college and my little brother is finishing up high schoool, I am grateful for the oppurtunities that my parents have provided for me.</p><p>I try to always have a good time and keep my attitude in check because attitude is EVERYTHING. I love hanging out with friends and having a good time. Often it is the people that you are around that make life enjoyable. My philosophy in life is to work hard, but know when to relax and have fun because otherwise life is not worth living.</p><html>

    <h2>Education Background</h2>
    <p>I graduated from Windsor High School in 2013. After graduating high school I decided to attend the city college in Santa Rosa and live at home. This gave me the time to adjust to a college schedule, work, save money, and gratefully allowed me to mature some before leaving the house. Luckily I was able to do this and it helped me more than I thought possible.</p><p>While at <a href=https://www.santarosa.edu/>Santa Rosa Junior College</a> I was getting the pre-nursing program classes out of the way because I wanted to be a nurse at the time. I realized however that was not for me so I switched to business and was able to apply to <a href=https://csumb.edu//>CSUMB</a> the day the applications were due.I spent my JC days working a lot and hanging out with my friends evey weekend, those were the low stress days.</p><p>I transferred here to CSUMB last year and have gotten involved with leadership here on campus. I am expecting to graduate next spring. I was behind in the business program when I transferred here and then I added a concentration which means I will be here just a little extra longer.</p> <div><body><img src="https://i.imgur.com/b3HazwC.png" alt="Mountain View" width="400" height="377"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/AFEVs3z.png" width="400" height="377"></body></div>

    <h2>Professional Background</h2>
  <p>My senior year in high school I worked at a small luxury in located in Healdsburg, California. I was promoted to an innkeeper and then quit after two years. I then got a job at Starbucks which I worked at for three and a half years. Before I cam to CSUMB I was working at a hotel on the weekends and worked at <a href=https://www.starbucks.com/menu?&utm_term=starbucks&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsoOQ6L6x2gIVCdtkCh3KJwLwEAAYASAAEgLYi_D_BwE&cm_mmc=google-_-BR+-+Brand+-+Starbucks+-+Desktop+-+Exact-_-Brand+-+Starbucks+-+Desktop+-+Exact-_-starbucks_mkwid%7CswofCu5MS_dc%7Cpcrid%7C202075197573%7Cpkw%7Cstarbucks%7Cpmt%7Ce&utm_campaign=BR+-+Brand+-+Starbucks+-+Desktop+-+Exact&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google/>Starbucks</a>. Working at Starbucks was a great experience. I learned on how to handle pressure in a fast-paced envrionment. This also meant that I had to learn good communication amoung teams and customers because there was not much time to waste. When I started getting bored of just working at Starbucks I started looking at other places to work. Then when I came here I got a job on campus in the housing office and worked at Starbucks at the same time.I enjoyed working at the housing office on campus because it was so close, convenient, and flexible. The most imporant part for me was that I was not handling food anymore. However I was not making enough to get by working there.</p><p>As of March 2018 I got an Accounting Clerk position for the <a href=https://www.esalen.org/>Esalen Institute</a> in their Carmel offices. I was looking for a job that was a part of the career field that I was looking to explore after graduation so I am so grateful I stumbled accross this place. So far I love this job and am learning a lot. They are also excited to have me there and I think that I will learn so much from working for this amazing company. Plus there are some good perks that I plan to enjoy while I work for them. I am unsure on what my long term career goals are, but I want to get as much experience as possible, since that can't hurt!

  <h3>Training and Skills</h3>
  <p>I have learned a lot about excel since attending CSUMB and feel comfortable working with the program. I have also attended leadership conferences for my positions here on campus. I was also QPR certified which was training on how to handle potential suicide victims.</p><p>Working at Starbucks I was also a certified Barista Trainer and was paid to train and coach new hires. I was also required to have a food handler's license which means I know the basics about food safety.</p><p>I hope to be able to use my interpersonal skills and my hard skills to get me into a career that I enjoy. I am currently considering working for a few years after I graduate then apply to get a Master's in Organizational Developement. This way I believe I can combine all my skills and experiences to make organizations better. Whether there is interpersonal issues, or system issuesm I will be able to contribute in some way.</p> You can check out my <a href="resume.docx">resume.</a>

<div id="Other" class="w3-container city" style=":display:none">
  <h3>Others</h3>
  <p>My first year at CSUMB I was able to get involved on campus and received the President position on the North Quad Area Council. I also became the treasurer for the Pride Club and later became the Vice President. At the end of last year I was elected to be the Vice President of Administration and Finance for the Residential Housing Association here on campus. And now I am looking forward to be the President of RHA next year since I was recently elected! From these positons I have learned how to develope strong team dynamics and group problem resolution skills. I have also noticed that I am comfortable taking charge of a situation like a group project. I do know when to be an influential follower. I do not always enjoy being in charge, especially with project, so I do not mind taking a helping role instead of a leading one.</p><p>When talking to people on campus I always try to encourage everyone to get involved in some way. I know the signifigance of being a part of a community and I know that everyone needs to feel apart of something. Plus I have to come to realize the importance of pushing yourself out of your comfort zone which is, to me, what college is all about. I constantly try to develope myself and be honest with my mistakes</p>
